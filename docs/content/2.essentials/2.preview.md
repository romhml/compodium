You can customize the preview by a `preview.vue` component inside the `compodium` folder to inject dependencies (styles, provider components...) for your components.

```vue [compodium/preview.vue]
<template>
  <AppProvider class="flex justify-center items-center h-screen w-screen">
    <slot />
  </AppProvider>
</template>
```
