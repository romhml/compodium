# Meta

This package is a modified version of `vue-component-meta` from [vue-language-tools](https://github.com/vuejs/language-tools). It was imported and modified to define a macro to extend component meta (`extendCompodiumMeta`). This macro is used by Compodium to pass additional configuration for components.
